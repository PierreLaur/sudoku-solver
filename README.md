# sudoku-solver

A simple sudoku solver app with a Svelte front-end. Uses OR-Tools CP-SAT as a solver.  
I made this to try out Svelte. It's pretty cool, I like it.

## Run

    pip install flask ortools  
    python backend/app.py &  
    cd frontend  
    npm install  
    npm run dev &  

or use ./run.sh to run everything
